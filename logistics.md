- Which lesson & episode should we choose?
- How will we eliminate set-up time?  Options:
    - Local JupyterHub or RStudio Server instance on a CiCS-provided research VM;
    - JupyterHub on ShARC with reserved computational resources - probably not, as requires all to have local HPC accounts.
    - [CoCalc][cocalc] Jupyter Notebooks:
        - Have [R support][cocalc-r].  
        - Free accounts may be sufficient - need to create in advance?
        - Opportunity to promote work done developing materials [for teachers on how to use CoCalc][cocalc-tutorial]
    - Azure Jupyter Notebooks
        - Need to create accounts in advance?
        - TA written notes on [how used Azure Notebooks for bioinformatics training][bad-days]
