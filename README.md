# Proposal

- Title: A highly interactive approach to teaching programming skills with Software & Data Carpentry
- Format: Workshop (1 h 30 m)
- Presenters: Jez Cope (University Library), â€¦

## Session description (no more than 250 words)

[Software Carpentry (SWC)][SWC] is an established initiative
providing training to researchers
to improve their ability to create good quality software for their research.
[Data Carpentry (DC)][DC] is a related project
which provides training to help researchers move beyond simple analysis in Excel.
DC is often seen as aiming to teach non-programmers to code,
and DC as aiming to teach self-taught programmers to code better
with an implied progression from one to the other.
However, the two are independent and complementary,
with DC going into more depth on data management techniques than SWC.

Both of these initiatives are built around a similar model:

- High quality workshop materials developed by the community
  and released under a Creative Commons license
- Two-day "bootcamp" workshop format,
  with sessions lead by instructors and assisted by helpers
  from the research discipline in question
- Certification programme for instructors grounded in evidence-backed pedagogy
- Well-recognised brand within the research community,
  with established criteria to use the Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry name

## How do you think others will benefit from the session?



## How will you incorporate the student perspective in this session?



## Plan for the session (workshop only)

1. Overview of teaching methods used in the Carpentries (30 minutes)
   - History: background & development of the Carpentry community
   - Pedagogy: live coding; graded examples
   - Instructor development
2. Taster session (60 minutes)
   - Participants will be led through a short part of one of the Data Carpentry lessons
