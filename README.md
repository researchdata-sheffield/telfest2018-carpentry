# Proposal (90 minute workshop)

## Session description (no more than 250 words)

[Software Carpentry (SWC)][SWC] is an international initiative
providing training to researchers
to improve their ability to create good quality software for their research.
[Data Carpentry (DC)][DC] provides training to help researchers
improve the robustness and reproducibility
of their analysis workflows.

Both of these initiatives are built around a similar model:

- High quality workshop materials developed by the community
  and released under a Creative Commons license
- Two-day "bootcamp" workshop format,
  with sessions lead by instructors and assisted by helpers
  from the research discipline in question
- Certification programme for instructors grounded in evidence-backed pedagogy
- Well-recognised brand within the research community,
  with established criteria to use the Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry name

[SWC]: http://software-carpentry.org/
[DC]: http://datacarpentry.org/

This workshop will explore the advantages of this model
and provide participants with an opportunity
to experience first-hand a small slice of a Data Carpentry workshop.

## How do you think others will benefit from the session?

The Carpentries are built on modern, research-backed psychology and pedagogy,
and are thus quite different from programming courses
run along more traditional lines.
Participants will benefit from learning about
the theory behind the material and instructional style
as well as experiencing it for themselves.

## How will you incorporate the student perspective in this session?

Participants will be placed directly in the students' shoes,
having the opportunity to experience
the Carpentry style of teaching as learners.

**Please note:**
All participants will need access to a laptop during the session.

## Plan for the session (workshop only)

1. Overview of teaching methods used in the Carpentries (30 minutes)
   - History: background & development of the Carpentry community
   - Pedagogy: live coding; graded examples
   - Instructor development
2. Taster session (60 minutes)
   - Participants will be led through a short part of one of the Data Carpentry lessons
   - *Need to decide which lesson & which episode*
